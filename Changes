Revision history for Perl extension Formatter::HTML::HTML.

0.96	2005-09-16
	- Added an config_file hashref parameter, useful for enabling
	users to configure tidy, adding the possibility of XHTML output.

0.95	2005-03-10
	- Test depend on specific versions of stuff. That is bad, but
	  I think I'll just mark them TODO for now.
	- Added SIGNATURE.

0.94	2005-02-01
	- Second release. Does really work! Thanks to Ben Trott for
	pointing out that the clean method actually returns the
	cleaned string, not just OK. 

0.93_1 	2005-01-28 
	- Initial release. Doesn't really work...
