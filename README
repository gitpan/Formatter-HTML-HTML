Formatter-HTML-HTML version 0.93_1
==================================

This module conforms to the Formatter API Specification, version
0.93. The specification itself can be found in the Formatter module on
CPAN. 

This Formatter is intended to be used to clean up existing HTML from
various sources. To do this, it lets HTML::Tidy do the
work. HTML::Tidy again, lets libtidy do the hard work. libtidy is the
HTML clean-up code Dave Raggett at W3C started. Pretty hefty stuff! 

Unfortunately, I can't get HTML::Tidy to work... :-( The present
release is pretty much how I think the module should be, but it
doesn't work. It is uploaded to CPAN in the hope that somebody spots
the bug. In fact, if you can make test it, let me know, it means that
it works for you. For me, it fails tests 3 and 4 in 02insert.
If you grok the HTML::Tidy code, I would be very pleased if you give
me a hand! :-)

INSTALLATION

DEPENDENCIES

work.
